# Tap-to-click Alfred workflow

This Alfred workflow provides on/off  actions to control a MacBook trackpad's "tap to click" setting.

This is useful for enabling/disabling the setting when doing a lot of typing, in order to prevent accidental movements of the cursor.

The [`Tap-to-Click.alfredworkflow` file](/`Tap-to-Click.alfredworkflow`) is all you need to import into Alfred. I've also extracted that file here in this repo so the source can be seen here on GitHub.
